# Climate_science_assignment_LaTeX
Second year Earth and Climate Science course required a semester report which included analysis and interpretation of global climate data.
As part of the assignment, I've written a report on Ocean Acidification and analysed NOAA climate data from 1995 to 2009.
This file contains the PDF and LaTeX code for the same.
